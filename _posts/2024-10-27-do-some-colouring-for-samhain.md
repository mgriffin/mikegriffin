On mastodon, I follow an amazing Irish artist called [Ciara](https://mastodon.ie/@Ciaraioch) and she so generously provided a line drawing of one of her Samhain pictures for smallies to colour in (and hopefully big smallies too, because I'm going to join in the fun) 

Here's a link to the post with the image:
