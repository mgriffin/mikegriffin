For the Mayo AC 5k series this year, the club asked members to write up a short profile by answering some running related questions which were then posted on the club website. I took part and [my profile](https://www.mayoac.com/meet-the-runner-mike-griffin/) was added to the site in June.

To keep a record of it, I'm copying my answers here

<p>Blacklion, Co. Cavan native Mike Griffin runs anything from 400m up to the marathon and has been a key member of the Mayo AC relay track team.</p>

<div class="QNA_box">
<h4>1. When did you start running?</h4>
<p>My first race was a 10k with my Dad when I was about 10, but I’ve been running seriously with a club for about 14 years now.</p>
</div>

<div class="QNA_box">
<h4>2. What is your favourite distance?</h4>
<p>800m on the track. Long enough to be tactical but short enough to really go for it. It can be so easy to go out too hard and make the finishing line feel like it’s getting further away from you.</p>
</div>

<div class="QNA_box">
<h4>3. Favourite race you have done?</h4>
<p>Rock’n’Roll 10k in New Orleans. They closed the roads in the city and having police outriders with sirens on was a real buzz!</p>
</div>

<div class="QNA_box">
<h4>4. If money/time was no issue what place in the world would you love to train/race in?</h4>
<p>Iten in Kenya is the running Mecca but I also love to run on wild trails. The Lake District is supposed to be amazing for that.</p>
</div>

<div class="QNA_box">
<h4>5. What music/podcast do you listen to while running?</h4>
<p>None, I can’t listen to music while I run. That’s my time to unwind and get back to nature.</p>
</div>

<div class="QNA_box">
<h4>6. What is your favourite running gear?</h4>
<p>I’ve been using a Stryd pod to measure my running power for a while, and being able to look back at stats is really useful.</p>
</div>

<div class="QNA_box">
<h4>7. What food/drink do you promise yourself 1 mile from the finish line?</h4>
<p>Roast chicken is a common craving for some reason!</p>
</div>

<div class="QNA_box">
<h4>8. Run alone or with a buddy?</h4>
<p>If I can get out to the wilds by myself, but you’ll never push yourself as hard at the track as when you’re with a group. So it depends on the run really.</p>
</div>

<div class="QNA_box">
<h4>9. Favourite place to run in Mayo?</h4>
<p>There are some hills not far from me that always bring a smile to my face, mostly when I’ve finished climbing them. We’re very lucky to have such a varied countryside to run in.</p>
</div>

<div class="QNA_box">
<h4>10. Advice to anyone thinking of lacing up the runners?</h4>
<p>Slow down, not every run has to be your fastest, and you’ll improve quicker by going out regularly than always trying to smash it.</p>
