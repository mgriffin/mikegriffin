Last night I played my first full match for Castlebar Mitchels.

I was bitten again by the bug after watching the girls play and joined up with the Junior team for this year. We had to concede two league games before this because of lack of numbers but we had enough for a team yesterday. 

I was picked to play at wing back (number 7) against Westport in the Junior C championship on a scorcher of an evening. I was happy with how I played, I got on the ball a bit and covered off a few attacks. Could do with a bit more conditioning though, I was starting to cramp up by the end. 

The game finished in a draw, 1-9 each, after we were 3 points down at half time, 1-4 to 0-4. On to Ardagh at home in a few weeks.
