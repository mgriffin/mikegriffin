After almost eleven years, my time at GitHub has come to a close.
I've been swept up as part of the Microsoft layoffs and been made redundant.

I'm going to take some time to figure out how I feel about this situation and to think about what I want to do next.
For the moment, I'm going to spend more time with my family and get away from being always online.

I've had some great times as a Hubber (you'd hope so seeing as I stayed so long!)
I've seen amazing places, and met fantastic people that I hope I can manage to keep in touch with.
Maybe sometime in the future I might even work with them again.
