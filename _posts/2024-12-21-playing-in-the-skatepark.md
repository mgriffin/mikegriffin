There's a new skatepark that opened a few weeks ago in Castlebar. Last night I brought Róise and Sadhbh down to check it out. Róise brought her roller blades and Sadhbh had her scooter and her roller skates in the car. I brought my skateboard and hoped I wouldn't fall and break myself. 

We spent a good hour there, in the dark lit by the lights of the tennis club and apart from a few spills which left muddy trousers, we got on great. 

I've been looking forward to something like this being built here for ages so it's great to see it and play together.
