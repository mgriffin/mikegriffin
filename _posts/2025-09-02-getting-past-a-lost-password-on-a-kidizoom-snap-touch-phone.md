We've got a couple of these Kidizoom phones in the house and the girls are very protective of them so of course they set a password to access them.
And of course they regularly forget their password too!

So how can we get past this?

Luckily there's a way to clear the password and get into the phone without doing a full factory reset.

- Wake the phone from sleep
- Press any button to get to the password input screen
- Press `+ - + + -`
- Wait for a couple of seconds and you should be in

I'm leaving this here because I keep forgetting how to do it, thanks past me for leaving a note on my desk!
