Last night I went out to Claremorris to see Blindboy Boatclub doing a live podcast show. I was given the ticket for my birthday and Louise was supposed to be going with me too but she was in Portlaoise with Éabha.

I was there with Sinéad, Eamon and Niamh and it was a thoroughly enjoyable night. Blindboy had a death doula as a guest and given that my Dad passed away a few weeks ago, it was an emotional thing to watch and listen to. 

But it was so well done that three hours passed by in an instant and we all left having had a great time. 

If you're interested, [Blindboy has a podcast too](https://www.theblindboypodcast.ie) and I recommend giving it a listen. He might be an acquired taste but he goes in depth into some really niche subjects in an entertaining way
