Louise has been going to a weights class every week for a few months now and she finally persuaded me to give it a go this evening. I left her with the girls at the pool and headed down, not really knowing what I was letting myself in for. 

I met a couple of the lads at the door including one guy I already knew. Then Paddy came out and invited us in. I introduced myself and he paired me off with someone who has been going for a few weeks. 

We were told we'd be doing four sets of 10 reps on each exercise and off we went in our pairs. We started with a hex bar deadlift, with 20kg. After some pointers on technique, this one was pretty easy. 

Next up was the bench press @ 35kg. Again, I found this pretty easy and could have kept going. 

Curls and triceps were next, on the machine this time. I'm not sure what weight I was doing here, I can never really tell with these machines. 

Then we had ball slams and balancing against the wall. I'm not sure what this is really called ðŸ™‚ The ball slams were getting tough by the end, we did 3 sets of 15 instead because that's what my partner wanted. 

Overhead dumbbell press with 2x 10kg was up after that. I got through three sets but failed at 6 on the last set. 

Squats @ 20kg plus bar were straightforward but I felt a little twinge in my right groin by the end. Gonna have to watch this one. 

We finished up with decline sit ups and plank rows. No bother at all with these ones. 

A little bit of stretching and we were out by ten to, feeling a little tender and pretty well worked. I really enjoyed pushing it a little bit and wanted to do more but I know that there's some stiffness and DOMS on their way!
