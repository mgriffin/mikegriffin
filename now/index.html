<p>I work at GitHub as a Senior Engineer developing our support portal and some internal tools.
I mostly work with Ruby on Rails and some Bash to tie things together.</p>

<p>I'm learning to play the Uilleann Pipes, I got a practice set last September and I've been playing a bit most days since then.
This one's going to be a long term project<p>

<p>I'm currently training for a couple of 800m indoor races, namely the Mayo indoors at the start of February, and the National Masters in March.
Christmas and the current cold snap haven't helped me with my training at all!<p>
