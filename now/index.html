<p>I work at GitHub as a Senior Engineer developing our support portal and some internal tools.
I mostly work with Ruby on Rails and some Bash to tie things together.</p>

<p>I'm learning to play the Uilleann Pipes, I got a practice set last September and I've been playing a bit most days since then.
This one's going to be a long term project.
I've got a few tunes that I'm working through right now:
<ul>
  <li>Johnny Doherty's Reel</li>
  <li>The Humours of Tullycrine (Hornpipe)</li>
  <li>Whelan's Old Sow (Jig)</li>
  <li>Peter O'Byrne's Fancy (Jig)</li>
</ul>
